## ðŸ“–Overview
I made a resort hotel web site using React, Contentful, and Netlify for deploying. The configuration of this site is 3 pages which include Top page,  room search page and room detail page. Each room has info such as price, size, capacity, pets allowed, breakfast service and so on. These rooms data are managed using Contentful CMS. At Room page, User can search the best matching room with user's preference by using filter search. 

## ðŸ’»skill I used
HTML, CSS, React(include React context API), Contentful(headless CMS), Netlify

## ðŸ“…the purpose of this project
The reason why I choose this project is that I wanted to use a Headless CMS like Contentful to understand the pros and cons comparing traditional CMS such as Wordpress. I saw many pros using this CMS. Because Setting up the data at Contentful was so simple and I could use it with my front-end within 1hour.

## ðŸ˜¤production period
Around 1 weeks.

## ðŸ”¥What I stacked and how solved it.


## âœ‹What I want to progress for the next project.
Contentful is one of the good solutions for managing data. I would love to use it for other project as well.
